*Summary:*


> I am not going to explain each and every player's rating as most of them are pretty self explanatory. But there are a few on border line ratings.
>
> Lichtsteiner, Mustafi and Monreal have been awful in defense throughout the whole season whenever they have played. While former and later have got no legs to sustain the athleticism, the lesser I write about Mustafi the better it is as I can't put him in words.
